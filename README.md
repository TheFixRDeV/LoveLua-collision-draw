# README - Drawing Tool with Love2D

## Introduction

Just a tool created as part of my learning journey in Lua programming. Thx my Senior friend chatgpt to help me fix toons of shit.

This project is a drawing tool developed with Love2D, allowing users to create and manipulate geometric shapes like rectangles and circles and save inside volumes.txt to easy copy/past to my codes. It serves as my initial experience with Love2D, focusing on graphical programming and object management.

## Features

- **Save all**: save all volumes inside volumes.txt with id (automatic time to save, each time create, delete or quit)
- **Shape Drawing**: Create rectangles 2x (left mouse click) and circles 2x (right mouse click).
- **Object Manipulation**: Select and move objects using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`.
- **Object Scaling**: Hold `Shift` + `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to scale selected objects.
- **Object Cloning**: `C` Quickly clone selected object.
- **Object Delete**: `D` Quickly delete selected object.
- **Movable Camera**: Hold `Right Mouse`Navigate the canvas by moving the camera.
- **Data Loading**: Loads objects from a text file at startup.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure Love2D is installed.
   - Clone or download this repository.

2. **Execution**:
   - Place `background.png` in the same folder as the script.
   - Run the project using Love2D.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the graphical interface.
- Improve file management and save options.
- Add new shapes and functionalities.
- Add Grab and Move Objects
- Configuration menu
